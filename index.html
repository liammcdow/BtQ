                        2. Create a decision log for 1-2 weeks, noting every decision that comes to you.
                        <br><br>
                        3. Categorize each decision as:
                           - Strategic (impacts long-term direction)
                           - Operational (impacts day-to-day execution)
                           - Technical (requires specialized knowledge)
                        <br><br>
                        4. For each decision, note whether it:
                           - Must remain with you
                           - Could be delegated with training
                           - Could be delegated with a system/process
                           - Should already be delegated
                        <br><br>

                        <br><br>
                        2. Journal on these questions:
                           - Why did you start this business? (beyond financial reasons)
                           - What change do you hope to create in the world?
                           - What would make you proud of this business in 10 years?
                        <br><br>
                        3. Draft 3-5 purpose statements that capture your answers.
                        <br><br>
                        4. Test each statement by asking:
                           - Does it energize and inspire you?
                           - Is it authentic to your values?
                           - Can it guide difficult business decisions?
                        <br><br>
                        5. Refine your purpose statement until it resonates deeply.

                        <br><br>
                        2. Track your energy for 1-2 weeks, noting when you feel:
                           - Energized and in flow
                           - Drained and resistant
                        <br><br>
                        3. Review your calendar for the past month:
                           - Highlight activities you enjoyed
                           - Cross out activities you disliked
                        <br><br>
                        4. Identify patterns across these exercises.
